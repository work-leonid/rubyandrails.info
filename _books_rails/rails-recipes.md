## About the Book

From building custom forms and powering pages with JQuery to integrating with legacy databases, it's all here. Each recipe has been updated to reflect the latest features of Rails 3.1 and each lays out a distinctive solution to a problem you may be facing today or could well encounter tomorrow. In addition, you'll find half the book is stocked with new eye-opening solutions to such common problems as how to extend Rails, test and deploy your sites, or add a web service to your actions. And each recipe not only lays out a succinct solution, but explains its rationale and the technologies that make it work. Loaded with the insights of a Rails community leader, members of the Rails core team and other experts, this is the book you'll want to have at your side as you craft your next project.
