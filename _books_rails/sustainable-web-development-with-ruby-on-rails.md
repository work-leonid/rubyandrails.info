> Learn how to get the most out of Ruby on Rails without making a mess.

## About the Book

- Practical tips for each part of Railsâ€¦with examples
- Learn to use Rails, not abstract it away
- Manage and isolate your business logic without fancy patterns or libraries

Learn how to manage carrying costs in your app by strategically incurring opportunity costs

**Messy models with entangled dependencies and confusing callbacks?** Instead, put business logic in plain Ruby classes that use your models to access the database.

**Trying to fit functionality into resources based on your database tables?** Try using custom resources with standard routes and Active Models instead of tons of custom routes.

**Fighting with JavaScript, APIs, and Source Maps?** Embrace server-rendered views.

**Slow test suite?** Don't over test. Controllers don't need a test if you have a system test. Simple validations don't need tests. If your jobs are a single-line delegation to business logic, why test them?
