> Build modern and progressive web applications with Vue.js and Ruby on Rails.

## About the Book

As the Rails community embraces JavaScript, this book answers your most pressing questions, including how to integrate front-end technologies with Rails, whether to build a single-page application, when and how to use JavaScript in your project, how to scaffold a Vue component in Rails, and how to configure Vue.js in a Rails project.

This book explores how to manage and understand priorities when working with Vue on Rails and how to determine the best configuration for your project. You'll see how to reuse your Vue components in a Rails project with less coding and harness the component options, as well as how to use props, events and slots of Vue components. You'll also use webpacker to set up your project and pass data from your Vue component to a Rails controller and back. Finally, you’ll learn which is the best configuration for the router and how to test and deploy your application.
These topics are essential for developers and product owners because they cover end-to-end advice for building a web application incrementally or from scratch. Vue.js on Railsshows you just how easy it is to build and maintain a modern web app and save hundreds of hours integrating these two technologies.
