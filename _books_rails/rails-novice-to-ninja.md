> Build with Ruby on Rails. Get setup and start programming with Ruby, then move onto utilising models, views and controllers, setting layouts, ajax and turbolinks, protective measures, plugins, deployment and production with the Rails framework. You'll go from Ruby on Rails Novice, to Ninja in no time.

## About the Book
Rails: Novice to Ninja is an easy-to-follow, practical, and fun guide to Ruby on Rails for beginners. It covers all you need to get up and running, from installing Ruby, Rails and SQLite to building and deploying a fully-featured web application. The third edition of this book has been fully updated to cover Rails 5, the latest version of the framework.

Unlike many other Rails titles, this book doesn't assume that you are an experienced web developer, or that you've used Ruby before. An entire chapter is devoted to learning Ruby in a fun way, using the interactive Ruby console, so you can follow along at home. You'll be an accomplished Ruby programmer in no time!

You'll need to understand HTML and some CSS to use this book, but no prior Ruby or Rails experience is assumed.


## What you will learn

- Learn Ruby basics
- Build a practical, working project: a social news application
- Deploy your application and see it live on the Web
