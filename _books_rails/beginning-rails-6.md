> Springboard your journey into web application development and discover how much fun building web applications with Ruby on Rails can be.

This book has been revised to cover what's new in Rails 6 including features such as WebPack, advanced JavaScript integration, Action Mailbox, Action Text, system and parallel testing, Action Cable testing, and more.

Beginning Rails 6 gently guides you through designing your application, writing tests for the application, and then writing the code to make your application work as expected. It is a book that will guide you from never having programmed with Ruby, to having a Rails 6 application built and deployed to the web.

After reading and using this book, you'll have the know-how and the freely available source code to get started with your own Rails-based web development in days.

## Who This Book Is For

Someone with little to no Ruby or Rails experience, or possibly even someone with no experience developing web applications at all. A basic familiarity with the web and typical web terms is assumed, but you donâ€™t need to be an expert in these.
