### The different kinds of Rails tests
There are several different types of RSpec tests you can use. I show which ones to use and which ones to skip.

### The various Rails testing tools and how to use them
Covers RSpec, Factory Bot, Capybara, VCR and WebMock.

### How to decide which testing framework to use
Explains how to decide between the two big testing frameworks, RSpec and MiniTest.

### How to make testing a habit
It's not enough to know how to write tests, you actually have to do it. I show you how to make testing a habit.

### What level of test coverage to shoot for
Shows what level of test coverage to shoot for (hint: it's not a number).

### How to add tests to an existing Rails project
Adding tests to an existing Rails project is a whole different ballgame from testing a greenfield app. I show you how.

### How to set up a new Rails project for testing
I show you exactly how I set up all my new Rails projects.

Are you testing "wrong" if you don't do TDD? I show you my approach to test-driven development.

### Ruby DSLs (domain-specific languages)
Gain a solid understanding of how DSLs (domain-specific languages) work so you can understand the DSLs of RSpec, Factory Bot and Capybara.

### Factory Bot

### Mocks and Stubs
Test doubles, the difference between mocks and stubs, when to use mocks and stubs.

### VCR and WebMock
Why to use VCR and WebMock, installation and configuration, how to use VCR and WebMock.
