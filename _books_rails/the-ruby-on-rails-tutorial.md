> Learn professional-grade web application development with Ruby on Rails

## About the Book

Since its initial publication in 2010, the Ruby on Rails Tutorial has been one of the leading introductions to web development. In this bestselling tutorial, you’ll learn how to develop and deploy real, industrial-strength web applications with Ruby on Rails, the open-source web framework that powers top websites such as Hulu, GitHub, Shopify, and Airbnb. This new 6th edition has been fully updated for Rails 6.

## The Rails Tutorial approach
Since the launch of the first edition in 2010, the Ruby on Rails Tutorial has been the leading introduction to web development with Rails (Figure 1). And while it does use Rails specifically, the focus throughout the tutorial is on general skills that are useful no matter which specific technology you end up using. Once you understand how web apps work, learning another framework can be done with much less effort. That being said, the framework of choice—namely, Ruby on Rails—has never been a better choice for learning web development (Box 1).
