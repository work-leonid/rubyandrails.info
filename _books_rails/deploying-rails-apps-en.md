> A robust framework for provisioning servers with Chef and deploying reliably with Capistrano 3, including example code templates you can use directly.

## Mastering Rails application deployment

This book will show you from start to finish how to:

- Setup a VPS from Scratch
- Setup additional servers in minutes
- Use Capistrano 3 to deploy quickly and reliably
- Automate boring maintenance tasks 

This is the fifth edition of this book, updated April 2021 and using current releases of Chef, Capistrano, Rails and Sidekiq as well as Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

The fifth edition is currently in progress, with the core path of setting up a server and deploying with Capistrano completed including all sample code. The price is temporarily reduced while the supplementary chapters on what's happening behind the scenes and advanced configuration are completed, everyone who buys the book gets free updates for life.

If you've got applications on Heroku which are costing you a fortune, this will provide you with the tools you need to move them onto a VPS. This includes running several Rails Applications on a single VPS - great for small side projects.

If you're already running your app on a VPS but the deploy process is flaky - it sometimes doesn't restart or loads the wrong version of the code - this book provides a template for making the process hassle free.
