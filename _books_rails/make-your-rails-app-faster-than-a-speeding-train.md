> Learn how to transform your snail-paced Rails app into a sub-100 millisecond powerhouse.


The Complete Guide to Rails Performance is a full-stack course that gives you the tools to make your Ruby on Rails applications faster and more delightful for users, scale better and for less money, and take less effort to maintain.

I’ve created an exhaustive checklist for speeding up Rails applications:

- Implemented 34 strategies that have been tested by more than 1 million unique visitors.
- Identified the 4 strategies that account for the most performance impact. These strategies have solved 80% of performance problems in most applications.
- Used more than 20 different SaaS providers, performance-oriented Rubygems, backend service providers and more and found the perfect technical stack to make the entire performance optimization process simple (even if you’re a new developer or someone with a deep technical background).
These strategies have been tested and proven on my clients' sites and others.

While preparing this course, I’ve implemented each of my performance strategies on production websites like rubygems.org, sidekiq.org, the official Ruby website, and more.
