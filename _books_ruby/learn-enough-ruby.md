Ruby is an elegant object-oriented programming language with applications ranging from shell scripting and package management to full-stack web application development. Learn Enough Ruby to Be Dangerous is designed to get you started writing practical and modern Ruby programs as fast as possible, with a focus on the real tools used every day by software developers.
Learn Enough Ruby to Be Dangerous broadly follows the structure of Learn Enough JavaScript to Be Dangerous, which can be studied either before or after this tutorial.
